Project no: 6

Project due date: December 13 8AM

Project description: Add sounds and god mode to the project. The rest of the 
	project will be used to add polish and extra features to make the game 
	more fun and robust.

The easiest part of this project: Adding a god mode.

Problems that I had in completing this project: Finding sounds and editing them
	was difficult because the lab machines lack audio editing software.

Important notes: 
	1. Sound assets can be found in assets/Sounds folder
	2. Font assets can be found in Fonts folder
	1. AI code can be found in the folder labeled AI
	2. HUD code can be found in the folder called HUD
	2. Resource code can be found in Resources folder
	3. Explosions code can be found in folder called Explosions
	4. Shooting code can be found in folder called Shooting
	5. When player dies, he has a 2-second recover period in which it blinks and
		can't die. 
	6. You can permanently kill AI right now, but resources currently respawn
		if destroyed by the player. 
	7. I currently only use midpoint/distance collision. 
	8. Images in the HUD section of the XML file is not implemented yet. 
	9. Some of the AI looks wonky because I use edge-case values for testing 
		and because they stop moving when attacking. For example, I use 
		extremely low Field-of-View values for enemies that I want to put no
		effort in chasing the player. 
	10. The spirtes are still the same as the last project, except for the 
		player. I am currently learning to make better-looking sprites. 
	11. The video keeps dropping frames, so it looks very jumpy. I tired multiple
		ways to create the video, but they all came out that way. However, in 
		this video, I was able to show the HUD, toggling the HUD, the 
		collisions, and the AI chasing the player and stopping to attack 
		(with attack animations being added in a later project).

Game Description:
	My game concept has changed a ton since the time I first decided on a
	concept. Instead of a stealth game, as originally planned, I have decided
	to make a parody-action game. The player fights off waves of enemies spawned
	from a boss. Along the way, the p-layer picks up containers containing
	useful items. These (currently) include ammo, health, and parts for a 
	weapon that can defeat the boss. There are different ammo and weapon types.
	The player needs to defeat the boss before losing resources and becoming
	overwhelmed by the boss' minions. The player must also be careful to not 
	destroy all the parts of the god weapon so that they can defeat the boss.
	The player "wins" when the boss is defeated, and loses when their health
	drops to or below 0.

Major Changes:

	1. Added sounds.
	2. Added a conclusion.
	3. Added a boss.
	4. Added new weapon types.
	5. Added a restart option. 
	6. Added enemy types.
	7. Fixed an issue with IOmod that made loading static text to screen slow. 
	8. Added a new resource.
	9. Replaced many assets. 
	10. Added god mode.
